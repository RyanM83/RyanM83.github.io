## About Me

I am currently a 2nd year student at the University of the West of Scotland studying BSc Computer Games Development. I am proficient in using Adobe Animate, Photoshop as well as currently learning Blender, Unity, Unreal Engine, C# and Visual Studio. 

I am eager and determined to learn and develop my skills and experiences to expand my scope of work and personal attributes. I believe in experimentation, pushing boundaries and exploration in order to enhance creativity and originality.

I have a ‘can-do’ attitude towards everything I do and I have a keen eye for detail. I love to bring fresh and new ideas to the table in order to enhance outcomes. I approach every job with enthusiasm as I don’t believe in doing a job half-heartedly; a job is only worth doing if you’re going to do it well. I am a fast learner and give 100% to everything that I do.
